Tears in heaven
Tears for rememberance and tears for joy
Tears for somebody and this lonely boy
Out in the madness the all seeing eye
Flickers above us to light up the sky
Unchain the colours before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of fire
Just sixteen a pickup truck out of money out of luck
I've got nowhere to call my own hit the gas and here I go
I'm running free yeah I'm running free
I'm running free yeah Oh I'm running free
Spent the night in an L A jail and listened to the sirens wail
They ain't got a thing on me I'm running wild I'm running free
Puller here at the Bottle Top whiskey dancing disco hop
Now all the boys are after me and that's the way it's gonna be
I've been looking so long for you now you won't get away from my grasp
You've been living so long in hiding in hiding behind that false mask
And you know and I know that you ain't got long now to last
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past
You're standing in the wings there you wait for the curtain to fall
Knowing the terror and holding you have on us all
Yeah I know that you're gonna scratch me maim me and maul
You know I'm helpless from your mesmerising cat call
Keep your distance walk away don't take his bait
Don't you stray don't fade away
Watch your step he's out to get you come what may
Don't you stray from the narrow way
I'm running and hiding in my dreams you're always there
You're the Phantom of the Opera you're the devil you're just out to scare
You damaged my mind and my soul it just floats through the air
Haunt me you taunt me you torture me back at your lair
The only place where you can dream living here is not what it seems
Ship of white light in the sky nobody there to reason why
Here I am I'm not really there smiling faces ever so rare
A let's walk in deepest space living here just isn't the place
Stalks of light come from the ground when I cry there isn't a sound
All my feelings cannot be held I'm happy in my new strange world
Shades of green grasses twine girls drinking plasma wine
A look at love a dream unfolds living here you'll never grow old
Don't you hear me call Ooh
Giving a swish with your arse in the air don't you know what they're saying
Charlotte you're so refined when you take all the love that they're giving
Sticking with every man that you find don't you know what they're after
Charlotte you've got your legs in the air don't you hear all the laughter
Charlotte the Harlot show me your legs
Charlotte the Harlot take me to bed
Charlotte the Harlot let me see blood
Charlotte the Harlot let me see love
Taking so many men to your room don't you feel no remorse
You charge them a "fiver" It's only for starters
And ten for the main course
And you've got no feelings they died long ago
Don't you care who you let in
And don't you know you're breaking the law with the service you're giving
There was a time when you left me standing there
Picking up pieces of love off the floor
Well Charlotte you left me alone in there
To make your ends as a bloody whore
Well Charlotte you told me you love me true
Picking up pieces of love yesterday
Well Charlotte your draws are off color too
'Cause you're making love all day
Giving a swish with your arse in the air don't you know what they're saying
Charlotte you're so refined when you take all the love that they're giving
Sticking with every man that you find don't you know what they're after
Charlotte you've got your legs in the air don't you hear all the laughter
Won't you come into my room I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought Iron Maiden can't be sought
Oh Well wherever wherever you are
Iron Maiden's gonna get you no matter how far
See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead
Won't you come into my room I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought Iron Maiden can't be sought
Fierce is the gale
On the north sea
We drink and rejoice from the chalice
Holding the course
Through long nights and days
The ice and the hail bear no malice
Tow the line
Keep it fine
Every man seeks this end
Valhalla you are calling
Valhalla you are calling me home
Valhalla new day dawning
Valhalla this is where I belong I belong
We crash o'er the waves
Bite deep on the oars
Scouring the spray
On the storm's maul
Then lightning reveals
For what we all pray
By Odin in Asgard
It's land fall
Life from death
Combat rests
Heralds peace for the slain
Valhalla you are calling
Valhalla you are calling me home
Valhalla new day dawning
Valhalla this is where I belong I belong
The storm in the night takes us there
On an unrelenting tide
As the wind drives us ashore
Halls of Valhalla
Tow the line
Halls of Valhalla
Tow the line
Tow the line
Keep it fine
Every man seeks this end
The halls of Valhalla are calling me home
The halls of Valhalla that's where we belong
Valhalla you are calling
Valhalla you are calling me home
Valhalla new day dawning
Valhalla this is where I belong I belong
You're in for surprise
You're in for a shock
In London town streets
When there's darkness and fog
When you least expect me
And you turn your back I'll attack
I smile when I'm sneaking
Through shadows by the wall
I laugh when I'm creeping
But you won't hear me at all
All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the ripper
You'll soon shake with fear
You're never knowing if I'm near
I'm sly and I'm shameless
Nocturnal and nameless
Except for the ripper
Or if you like jack the knife
Any back alley street
Is where we'll probably meet
Underneath the gas lamp
Where the air's cold and damp
I'm a nasty surprise
I'm a Devil in disguise
I'm a footstep at night
I'm a scream out in fright
All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the ripper the ripper the ripper
Down at place called The Jug
With a girl named Linda Lou
When in walked a man
With a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you know who
He said "Hey there fellow
With the hair colored yellow
Whatcha tryin' to prove
'Cause that's my woman there
And I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you
I said excuse me
I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shaking like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean mean
Big and bad Lord
Pointin' that gun at me
"Oh wait a minute mister
I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble with you
And I know you don't owe me
But I wish you'd let me
Ask one favor from you"
"Oh won't you
Gimme three steps gimme three steps mister
Gimme three steps towards the door
Gimme three steps gimme three steps mister
And you'll never see me no more"
For sure
Well the crowd cleared away
And I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you son
Well it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four
Well he turned and screamed at Linda Lou
And that's the break I was looking for
And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out toward your door
"Oh won't you
Gimme three steps gimme three steps mister
Gimme three steps towards the door
Gimme three steps gimme three steps mister
And you'll never see me no more"
“It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything”
“I don't want to die without any scars” 
“This is your life and its ending one moment at a time”
“You know how they say you only hurt the ones you love Well it works both ways” 
“The things you used to own now they own you” 
“Today is the sort of day where the sun only comes up to humiliate you” 
“If you don't know what you want" the doorman said "you end up with a lot you don't” 
“I let go Lost in oblivion Dark and silent and complete I found freedom Losing all hope was freedom”
“It's not love or anything but I think I like you too”
“The lower you fall the higher you'll fly” 
“I am Jack's complete lack of surprise I am Jack's Broken Heart” 
“May I never be complete May I never be content May I never be perfect”
“Everyone smiles with that invisible gun to their head"
“I wanted to destroy everything beautiful I'd never have” 
“The girl is infectious human waste and she's confused and afraid to commit to the wrong thing and so she won't commit to anything”
Lime and limpid green a second scene 
A fight between the blue you once knew 
Floating down the sound resounds 
Around the icy waters underground 
Jupiter and Saturn Oberon Miranda 
And Titania Neptune Titan 
Stars can frighten 
Blinding signs flap 
Flicker flicker flicker blam Pow pow 
Stairway scare Dan Dare who's there 
Lime and limpid green 
The sounds surrounds the icy waters underground 
Lime and limpid green 
The sounds surrounds the icy waters underground
Lucifer Sam siam cat 
Always sitting by your side 
Always by your side 
That cat's something I can't explain 
Ginger ginger you're a witch 
You're the left side 
He's the right side 
Oh no 
That cat's something I can't explain 
Lucifer go to sea 
Be a hip cat 
Be a ship's cat 
Somewhere anywhere 
That cat's something I can't explain 
At night prowling sifting sand 
Hiding around on the ground 
He'll be found when you're around 
That cat's something I can't explain
There was a king who ruled the land 
His majesty was in command 
With silver eyes the scarlet eagle 
Showers silver on the people 
Oh Mother tell me more 
Why'd'ya have to leave me there 
Hanging in my infant air 
You only have to read the lines 
They're scribbly black and everything shines 
Across the stream with wooden shoes 
With bells to tell the king the news 
A thousand misty riders climb up 
Higher once upon a time 
Wandering and dreaming 
The words have different meaning 
Yes they did 
For all the time spent in that room 
The doll's house darkness old perfume 
And fairy stories held me high on 
Clouds of sunlight floating by 
Oh Mother tell me more 
Tell me more 
Alone in the clouds all blue 
Lying on an eiderdown 
Yippee You can't see me 
But I can you 
Lazing in the foggy dew 
Sitting on a unicorn 
No fair you can't hear me 
But I can you 
Watching buttercups cup the light 
Sleeping on a dandelion 
Too much I won't touch you 
But then I might 
Screaming through the starlit sky 
Traveling by telephone 
Hey ho here we go 
Ever so high 
Alone in the clouds all blue 
Lying on an eiderdown 
Yippee You can't see me 
But I can you
She said "I don't know if I've ever been good enough
I'm a little bit rusty and I think my head is caving in
And I don't know if I've ever been really loved
By a hand that's touched me and I feel like something's gonna give
And I'm a little bit angry"
Well this ain't over
No not here not while I still need you around
You don't owe me we might change
Yeah we just might feel good
I wanna push you around
Well I will well I will
I wanna push you down
Well I will well I will
I wanna take you for granted
I wanna take you for granted
Yeah well I will
She said "I don't know why you ever would lie to me
Like I'm a little untrusting when I think that the truth is gonna hurt ya
And I don't know why you couldn't just stay with me
You couldn't stand to be near me when my face don't seem to want to shine
'Cause it's a little bit dirty"
Well don't just stand there
Say nice things to me
'Cause I've been cheated I've been wronged
And you you don't know me
I can't change I won't do anything at all
I wanna push you around
Well I will well I will
I wanna push you down
Well I will well I will
I wanna take you for granted
I wanna take you for granted
Yeah well I will
Oh but don't bowl me over
Just wait a minute well I kinda fell apart
Things get so crazy crazy
Don't rush this baby
Don't rush this baby baby baby
I wanna push you around
Well I will well I will
I wanna push you down
Well I will well I will
I wanna take you for granted
I wanna take you take you
Yeah well I will I will I will I will yeah
Well I will I will I will yeah
Push you around
I wanna push you around
Well I will
