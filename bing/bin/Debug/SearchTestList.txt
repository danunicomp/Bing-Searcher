LYNYRD SKYNYRD ere I sit all by myself
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Wonderin' how she could put our love on a shelf
LYNYRD SKYNYRD A crowd of people, they pass me by
LYNYRD SKYNYRD But all I can do is hang my head and cry
LYNYRD SKYNYRD (chorus)
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Blame it on a sad song in the night
LYNYRD SKYNYRD I don't want anyone but you to make it right
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Blame it on a sad song in the night
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Well, it's an old familiar feelin'
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Girl, it's got my heart reelin'
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Don't want to hear a sad song in the night
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Anymore
LYNYRD SKYNYRD When I was 15 I dreamed of leaving my home
LYNYRD SKYNYRD I had to see the world
LYNYRD SKYNYRD And live like a rolling stone
LYNYRD SKYNYRD I heard California was paved in gold
LYNYRD SKYNYRD So I hopped on that train
LYNYRD SKYNYRD It didn't come easy
LYNYRD SKYNYRD But I keep thinkin' bout
LYNYRD SKYNYRD The green grass and missing my home
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Take me back to my southern ways
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Where I can be myself and live another day
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Take me back to my southern ways
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Where the tall pines blow and the southern winds kiss my face
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Oh southern grace
LYNYRD SKYNYRD There's a little place down in Jackson County
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Right off the river road
LYNYRD SKYNYRD If you wanna take a ride to the end of the rainbow
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Find yourself a pot of gold
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Everybody asks me where I'm goin'
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Yeah everybody wants to know
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Your sister says she wants to come along with me
LYNYRD SKYNYRD I know she really wants to go
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Yeah I know she really wants to go
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Down, Down, Down, Down
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Down is where I wanna go
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Down, Down, Down, Down
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Down to the Honey Hole
LYNYRD SKYNYRD If you wanna check it out on a hot summer night
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Climb over the garden wall
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Grab your little baby and hold her tight
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Underneath the sugar falls
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Underneath the sugar falls
LYNYRD SKYNYRD ere I sit all by myself
LYNYRD SKYNYRD Wonderin' how she could put our love on a shelf
LYNYRD SKYNYRD A crowd of people, they pass me by
LYNYRD SKYNYRD But all I can do is hang my head and cry
LYNYRD SKYNYRD (chorus)

LYNYRD SKYNYRD Underneath the sugar falls
Well he walks so tall to be so small
Never met a man who's stranger
He lives his life for a dollar sign
And to deal with him is dangerous
He knocked me down but I'm on my feet
Now I'm so much wiser
I'd rather quit and go back home
Than to deal with the money miser
Let's cry for this bad man
I sing a song for the bad man
Well, you treat me right baby, I'll treat you right
That's the way its supposed to be
I put my faith down in my friend
And he almost put an end to me
Well I work seven days a week
Eight when I am able
When you take money from me you take food from my mama's table
Let's cry for this bad man
I wrote a song for the bad man
Hey, when is the last time you sat down and had dinner with your kids?
Talked about what's going on in their lives?
Hey, when is the last time you just stopped and helped somebody out?
I bet you can't remember
Well a lot of people are sayin'
"We're changing for the better"
Well that don't interest me
I like the simple life
The way it USED to be
We left our doors wide open
We didn't need no key
I've been around the world
Seen all there is to see
I'd trade ALL THOSE memories for ONE MORE DAY
How it used to be
I like the Simple Life
